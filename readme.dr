15Feb23 - Working on Ansible for DevOps by Jeff Geerling
Got ansible working
brew install ansible
ansible -i hosts.ini AWS_Instances -m ping -u ubuntu  --private-key=DaveKey -vvv>logfile2
explicitly set private key since it did not have it in the config file.

Next add ansible.cfg
ansible -i hosts.ini AWS_Instances -m ping -u ubuntu
ansible -i hosts.ini AWS_Instances -a "free -h" -u ubuntu ## shows free memory on all your servers in the host file

Now use a playbook to check Chrony is installed and running
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts.ini -u ubuntu
needed to change 'yum' to 'package' in playbook because of using Ubuntu distro


    6  which ansible
    7  sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible
    8  sudo apt-get update
    9  apt-get install -y ansible
   10  sudo apt-get install -y ansible
   11  ansible --version
   12  sudo apt-get vagrant
   13  history
   14  sudo apt-get install -y vagrant
   15  sudo apt-get install -y virtualbox
   16  pwd
   17  mkdir VagrantFiles
   18  cd VagrantFiles/
   19  vagrant box add ubuntu/noble64
   20  vagrant init ubuntu/noble64
   21  vagrant up

There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant
for controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.

Command: ["startvm", "d205656f-664b-4881-aa17-1ab6534793b3", "--type", "headless"]

Stderr: VBoxManage: error: VT-x is not available (VERR_VMX_NO_VMX)
VBoxManage: error: Details: code NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005), component ConsoleWrap, interface IConsole

Vagrant doesn't work on a cloud EC2 instance. Vt-x cannot be nested.

This exercise was to use ChatGPT to advise on python code to 
- bring up an instance
    BringUpLinuxInstance.py
- Another to list what EC2 are running in your AWS account
    ListRunningInstances.py
- Another script to list and terminate what is there.
    ListAndTerminateRunningInstances.py

Main problems were relating to the private key. Need to specify the private key, not the public key when SSH into the EC2 instance! 

ssh -i DaveKey ubuntu@ec2-54-74-212-158.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
